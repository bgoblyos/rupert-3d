A Haskell program that checks polyhedra for Rupert's property by randomly projecting it and testing the projections, based on [arXiv:2112.13754v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13754.pdf).

This project is a proof of concept, parallelization, further optimizations and other features are still work in progress.

`gnuplot` is required for generating plots.
